# freeCodeCamp Projects 
Welcome to my freeCodeCamp Projects repository! This repository contains all the projects I've completed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. These projects demonstrate my skills in web development, JavaScript algorithms and more upcoming projects from the course that I will take.

Feel free to explore each project to see the code and functionality. You can use these projects as references for your own learning and development. 
### Projects Included:
